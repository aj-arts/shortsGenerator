# YouTube Video Scraping for Background Videos

We used PyTube and the YouTube API in order to scrap the desired background video for the short-form content.

### used_videos.txt

Any video used for a short will be added to used_videos.txt to prevent reusage with the same prompt. If you wish to reuse videos comment out lines 89, 90, and 91. We would recommend to just empty the txt file every so often or you may run out of videos.

### documentation

Look inside video.py for proper documentation and function explanations.
